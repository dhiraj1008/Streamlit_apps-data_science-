# Build 12 Data Apps in Python with Streamlit
## Data Exploration and Visulization
## app1_simple_stockprice
### Here i will be showing you how to build a stock price web application in Python using the Streamlit and yfinance library. The app will be able to retrieve company information as well as the stock price data for S and P 500 companies

## app2_eda_basketball
### Here i will be showing you how to build a Basketball Player Data Explorer Web App in Python using the Streamlit library. Particularly, the data will be web scraped on-demand directly from the Basketball-Reference.com website and used for data pre-processing before displaying the filtered data in the web app.

## app3_eda_sand500_stock
### Here i will be building a Stock price web app in Python using the Streamlit library in Python. Firstly, we will be developing a simple webscraper of the S&P500 data. Secondly, the resulting list of ticker symbols will be used to subsequently fetch the stocks price data from the yfinance library in Python. Finally, we will be combining both functions in the creation of the web app.

## app4_eda_football
### Here I will be showing you how to build an NFL Football data web app in Python using the Streamlit library. We will be webscraping football data from Pro-Football-Reference.com that are then used for making the web app.

## app5_bioinformatics_dna
### Here i will be showing you how to build a very simple Bioinformatics web app in Python using the Streamlit library called the "DNA nucleotide count web app". Essentially, the web app will take in a query sequence and counts the nucleotide composition in percentage for each of the 4 nucleotides (adenine, thymine, guanine and cystosine).

## Data Exploration,Visulization and Machine learning
## app6_iris_classification
### Here I will show you how to build a simple machine learning model in Python. Particularly, we will be using the scikit-learn package in Python to build a simple classification model (for classifying Iris flowers) using the random forest algorithm.

## app7_molecular_solubility_regression
### Here I will be showing you how to build a Bioinformatics web app in Python using the Streamlit library. Particularly, the web app will allow the prediction of the solubility (LogS) of molecules, which is an important property for drug discovery.

### app8_penguin_classification
### Here iwill show you how to build an (intermediate level of difficulty) machine learning powered data science web app in Python using the streamlit library in a little over 100 lines of code. Particularly, we will be building a Penguins species classification web app using the Palmer Penguins dataset (4 quantitative variables and 3 qualitative variables; 1 of the qualitative variable will be used as the target variable for classification).

### app9_Boston_House_Price_Regression
### Here i will be showing you how to build a simple machine learning web app (using the Boston Housing dataset) in Python using the Streamlit library

## All the required data sets are also available ..
